DBIx::Class::Async::Storage::DBI - DBI-based async storage backend for DBIx::Class::Async

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.58

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Typically obtained via the storage of an async schema
    my $storage = $schema->storage;

    # Async Cursor / Streaming Support

    my $rs = $schema->resultset('User')->search({ active => 1 });

    # Create an async cursor to iterate over results without blocking the loop
    my $cursor = $storage->cursor($rs);

    # Iterate through the results one by one
    my $next_item;
    $next_item = sub {
        $cursor->next->then(sub {
            my $row_data = shift;
            return Future->done unless $row_data; # End of stream

            say "Processing user data: " . $row_data->{name};

            # Recurse to get the next item
            return $next_item->();
        });
    };

    $next_item->()->get;

    # Low-Level Execution

    # Execute raw SQL through the worker pool
    $storage->execute_all("UPDATE users SET last_login = ?", [ time ])
            ->then(sub {
                say "Bulk update complete.";
            });

    # Modern Async/Await iteration (Recommended)
    use Future::AsyncAwait;

    my $cursor = $schema->storage->cursor($rs);

    async sub process_all_users {
        while (my $row = await $cursor->next) {
            say "Streaming user: " . $row->name;
        }
        say "All users processed.";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a DBI-based storage backend for L<DBIx::Class::Async::Schema>.
It extends L<DBIx::Class::Async::Storage> and implements DBI-specific functionality
for managing database connections and operations in an asynchronous worker pool
environment.

Unlike traditional L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI>, this storage class does not
maintain database handles in the parent process. Instead, database handles are
managed by worker processes, allowing for non-blocking asynchronous database
operations using L<Future> objects.

This class is automatically instantiated when you connect to a database using
L<DBIx::Class::Async::Schema/connect> and generally does not need to be
instantiated directly.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 dbh

  my $dbh = $storage->dbh;

Returns C<undef> in async storage mode.

Unlike traditional L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI>, the async storage layer does
not maintain a database handle in the parent process. Instead, database handles
are held by worker processes in the background worker pool, which execute
queries asynchronously.

This method exists for API compatibility with standard L<DBIx::Class> storage
objects, but always returns C<undef> to indicate that direct database handle
access is not available in async mode.

  my $storage = $schema->storage;
  my $dbh = $storage->dbh;  # Always undef in async mode

  if (!defined $dbh) {
      say "Running in async mode - no direct DBH access";
  }

If you need to perform database operations, use the L<DBIx::Class::Async::ResultSet>
and L<DBIx::Class::Async::Row> methods which handle async execution transparently
through the worker pool.

=cut

sub dbh {
    my $self = shift;
    # In Async mode, the parent process doesn't hold a DBH.
    # The workers hold the DBHs.
    return undef;
}

=head2 cursor

  my $cursor = $storage->cursor($resultset);

Creates and returns a L<DBIx::Class::Async::Storage::DBI::Cursor> object
for asynchronously iterating through a ResultSet's rows.

The cursor provides a low-level interface for fetching rows one at a time
using Futures, which is useful for processing large result sets without
loading all rows into memory at once.

B<Arguments>

=over 4

=item * C<$resultset> - A L<DBIx::Class::Async::ResultSet> object

=back

B<Returns>

A L<DBIx::Class::Async::Storage::DBI::Cursor> object configured for the
given ResultSet.

  use Future::AsyncAwait;

  my $rs = $schema->resultset('User');
  my $cursor = $storage->cursor($rs);

  my $iter = async sub {
      while (my $row = await $cursor->next) {
          say $row->name;
      }
  };

  $iter->get;

The cursor respects the ResultSet's C<rows> attribute for batch fetching:

  my $rs = $schema->resultset('User')->search(undef, { rows => 50 });
  my $cursor = $storage->cursor($rs);  # Fetches 50 rows at a time

See L<DBIx::Class::Async::Storage::DBI::Cursor> for available cursor methods.

=cut

sub cursor {
    my ($self, $rs) = @_;

    # Just like DBIC, we return a DBI-specific cursor
    return DBIx::Class::Async::Storage::DBI::Cursor->new(
        storage => $self,
        rs      => $rs,
    );
}

=head2 debug

  # Get current debug level
  my $level = $storage->debug;

  # Set debug level
  $storage->debug(1);

Gets or sets the debug level for the storage layer.

When called without arguments, returns the current debug level (defaults to 0).
When called with an argument, sets the debug level to the specified value and
returns it.

B<Arguments>

=over 4

=item * C<$level> (optional) - Integer debug level (0 = off, higher values = more verbose)

=back

B<Returns>

The current or newly set debug level.

  # Enable debugging
  $storage->debug(1);

  # Check if debugging is enabled
  if ($storage->debug) {
      say "Debug mode is on at level " . $storage->debug;
  }

  # Disable debugging
  $storage->debug(0);

B<Note>: The actual debug output behavior may vary depending on the storage
implementation and connected database driver.

=cut

sub debug {
    my ($self, $level) = @_;
    return $self->{debug} = $level if defined $level;
    return $self->{debug} || 0;
}

=head1 ARCHITECTURE

This storage class implements a distributed, non-blocking execution model that
differs fundamentally from traditional L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI>:

=over 4

=item B<No Parent Process DBH>

The parent process never instantiates a L<DBI> handle. All database connections
are isolated within worker processes. This prevents the B<"forked handle">
corruption common in multiprocess Perl applications and keeps the main event
loop lightweight.

=item B<Async Operations>

Every database interaction (search, create, update, etc.) returns an
L<IO::Async::Future> object. This allows the main application to continue
processing web requests, timers, or other I/O while waiting for the worker
to return results.

=item B<Worker Pool via IO::Async::Function>

Queries are dispatched to a persistent pool of background workers. By using
persistent workers with B<state-cached connections>, the bridge eliminates
the latency of C<connect/disconnect> cycles for every query.

=item B<Transparent API>

The bridge provides a high degree of parity with the standard DBIC API.
Advanced features like C<prefetch>, C<collapse>, and complex transactions
(C<txn_do>) are supported through a specialised serialisation layer that
reconstructs object graphs across process boundaries.

=back

=cut

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 Transaction Management

Transactions in L<DBIx::Class::Async> differ from standard L<DBIx::Class>
because the I/O is delegated to a worker pool. You cannot use the
traditional C<< $schema->storage->txn_begin >> pattern in a non-blocking
loop, as subsequent calls might be routed to different workers.

=head3 The Recommended Approach: C<txn_do>

To ensure atomicity, use the C<txn_do> or C<txn_batch> methods. These
methods bundle multiple operations into a single "Instruction Set" that
is dispatched to a B<single worker process>.

The worker executes the entire block within a local database transaction.
If any step fails, the worker performs a local C<rollback> and returns
the error to the parent process.

=head3 Placeholder Resolution

The async C<txn_do> supports internal variable registration. You can
create a record in Step A and use its auto-incremented ID in Step B
using the C<$name.id> syntax. This allows for complex, multi-step
dependent operations to remain fully asynchronous and atomic.

=head2 ResultSet State

Because data is deflated for transport between the worker and the parent,
the objects returned by C<on_done> are "POPO" (Plain Old Perl Objects/HashRefs)
rather than "Live" L<DBIx::Class::Row> objects. Calling methods like
C<update> or C<delete> on these returned objects will not affect the
database directly.
